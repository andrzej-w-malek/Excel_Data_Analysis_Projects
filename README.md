## Salary Dashboard

A Dashboard quickly showing the average income of data jobs in 2023. It includes a breakdown by job title, location and type, as well as a few KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

## Salary Analysis

In the second project, we analyze the salary data in more detail. We look at the most desired skills in data job postings and how they affect salaries. The analysis includes, amongst others, visualizations of the most common skills and their impact on pay.
